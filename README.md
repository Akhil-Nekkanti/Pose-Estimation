# Pose-Estimation
Python tool for visualizing human poses by projecting 2D image coordinates into a 3D space using matplotlib.

Developed as part of a research project at UC Irvine, this tool processes pose data from 2D images and renders interactive 3D plots for analysis.

For methodology, algorithms, and results, see ./Nekkanti-PoseEstimation.pdf
